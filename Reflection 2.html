                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">This activity was one of my favorites because we were grouped and we had the opportunity to brainstorm together. We all gave out suggestions about a few problems we think we can solve through our app. It was very difficult at first because we were all struggling to think outside the box. We were trying to think of complicated problems the we’d seen around us. When we thought of simpler things, we eventually reached a decision. Instead of searching far and wide, we decided to think of a problem we’d encountered in school. 
<br>
<br>	Our last meeting was conducted at the Microsoft room and I was excited because it was my first time entering that room. It was a nice change of scenery because we spend most of our time inside the computer labs. I could tell that everyone was excited to have our lecture because of the cozy and colorful room. Our next activity was to share our app idea with everyone. We had to organize our thoughts and write them on the board properly. We couldn’t explain our concept clearly but overall, I was happy that all of our members were able to contribute. After class, we talked about dividing the work for our paper prototypes. We started working on them last weekend and things look good so far. I hope my group can continue to be productive in the coming days.
<br>
<br>	One thing worth mentioning is that I feel pressure being a design leader. I’ve always been more comfortable and productive being the “number 2” guy when it comes to group activities. I mean, I’ve led in sports and in music but it’s really different when it comes to acads. It’s a struggle because of my personality. I’m not good at telling other people what to do, for example my groupmates, I don’t know how to tell them to work in a way that won’t make me seem bossy. I CAN call out members in music because music’s my thing. I do not hesitate to call out people who make mistakes because they didn’t practice. Being a leader in this class is definitely going to be a learning experience for me. &nbsp;<br></p>
